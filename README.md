# Phone Book Application

This project is a Phone Book Application built with JavaScript, Material UI, Node.js, React, Apollo Server, GraphQL, and Jest for unit testing.

## Overview

The Phone Book Application provides a user-friendly interface for managing contacts efficiently. Users can add, search, update, and delete contacts seamlessly.

## Features

- **Contact Number Search**: Users can search for contact numbers based on usernames.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Search functionality is case-insensitive, enabling users to search regardless of case matching.
- **Responsive User Interface**: The UI is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application follows a client-server architecture for data fetching.
- **GraphQL and Apollo Server**: Communication between client and server is facilitated through GraphQL queries and Apollo Server, enhancing data querying capabilities.
